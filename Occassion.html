        <p>Azores, Portugual August 2023<br><br>Hey! When I visited the Azores, it was the end of the<br> summer months, but it is important to understand the choice of clothing in the Azores is mainly influenced by the weather.<br><br>It is worth noting that the locals and the tourist shops on the island suggest that the weather can change often throughout the day, almost like experiencing all four seasons in one day.</p></div>
